This game was written in part following [Aasif Khan's tutorial](https://www.appypie.com/creating-a-simple-ios-game-with-swift-in-xcode). The assets used were made by me.

At the end of the tutorial Aasif lists a few challenges for the student:
1. changing the game length - for this one I added a variable `gameLength` and made the variable `seconds` [lazy](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/properties/#Lazy-Stored-Properties), which allows it to be initiated with `gameLength`,
2. I am working on a more interesting scoring mechanism,
3. for letting the player know if they answered right I flash the background different colors (green for correct and red for wrong),
4. incorporating GameKit is also in the works.
